Dreams are important, because they reveal that
there are parallel processing schemes in your own brain.

They are a window into the unconscious.

Perhaps, then there is no need to interpret them. Any interpretation
that one has constrains unconscious brain of any processing. 

In any case, I had another dream today.

I was riding the bus. You could give the bus instructions on where to drop you off. It was
some bureaucratic process where you submitted a form and had to wait a few days to see if it would happen,
if the bus would stop where you wanted it to.

So I instructed the bus to stop at a strip mall that had a Boston Market in it. It was
next to a place to submit taxes, or so I thought. The dream was not very coherent.

One day the bus did stop in this strip mall. I walked to the Boston Market and it was closed.
There were employees inside, and I tried to get one's attention to let me in. He didn't let me in.
Someone walked out to throw away garbage or do some other kind of chore. I stood there and tried to
ask, "Does Boston Market let you submit your taxes here?" Someone answered no, and we left.
I don't exactly remember who was with me, I think it was my brother.

I felt defeated. Home was too far to walk to, and so we went next door to the Boston Market.
There were a bunch of thugs there. My younger sister might have been with me, it was at this
time I felt very protective of whoever was with me.

We may have gotten into a fight. My dad showed up at the strip mall, and I talked to him
about what I was trying to do. Then the dream changed.

I was preparing for my high school graduation, several days before graduation. I was to
play in the band, and I had a solo. I also was concerned about dressing appropriately
for the photo.

So the day of graduation approaches pretty quickly, and I'm late to some photo shoot.
I'm wearing a collared shirt I think, and I'm running across a campus through some 
museum exhibits. I arrive close to the venue, and I walk through some quiet, aesthetic
places. Then I see that there is a procession, like they have at a Catholic mass. The
procession is intimidating, and reminds me that I am late to the photo shoot. Women have
veils and men are wearing altar boy garb. 

I run up some stairs through a crowd, and I don't see the central place where everyone
ends up. I realize that I forgot to bring my trumpet to play my solo and to take part in
the band. So my next task is to run across campus into the high school, and go to the
high school band hall.

I run through a crowd of people. I see some familiar faces, I stop to see that my friend
already has his instrument. He's well-dressed. The instrument is some simpler version of
the french horn, and he says something along the lines of, "these are our new instruments.
they're lighter and better."

I push past the crowd and I run across campus. I look at a map of campus to see where I need to enter
to go to band the quickest. I have no idea if I saw a map and couldn't interpret it
or if I wasn't able to find a map at all. In any case, I end up in the high school
at where I thought the cafeteria should've been. There were stairs and rows of class
rooms, but I had trouble finding the cafeteria.

When I found the cafeteria, I thought I would know where the band hall was, so I sprinted
in the direction where I thought it would be, but it was rows of classrooms.
I realized at some point, the school had been renovated and I had no idea where things
were and where they were supposed to be.

Then I realized that the trumpet I had been chasing, I left it at home, and there was
no way that I'd get it and make it to the photo shoot and the solo performance.

I don't even know if the solo was for the trumpet, it might have been for a different
version of the trumpet.

Then I woke up.
