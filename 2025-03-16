- if there are api outputs that are structured then what databases can you populate?
  - some super abstract one?
  - mathematics database
  - a way to learn quickly, some kind of flash card ranking system
  - code quality database?
  - when open ai asks you to compare two different responses, is it stored locally for your preferences? how is the broader system architected.
  - question database
  - music ranking database
  - movie ranking database
  - basketball player database
  - art database
