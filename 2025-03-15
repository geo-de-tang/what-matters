Many forks in the road.

Ideas, I currently find engaging:

- query LLM apis to rank comments on topics for forums to see the meta stats of a forum and gauge the crowd opinion

- scrape sec.gov into a database to answer questions like:
  "how many actions against this person are being pursued by the SEC?"
  "how many actions against this person have ever been pursued?"
  "how many actions 'failed'?"
  "how many actions 'succeeded'?"

- build a transaction table where you can see the previous owners of a valuable item

- build a website to view transaction table and to transact high end items

- rewrite sorting algorithms and compare their performance

- rewrite database so that I have control over the software


How should I rank these in order of importance?

Some things are dependencies.

Can this be put into structured form?

Why do I find database still relevant?

Database is a formal way to preserve information. The structure keeps things organized and accessible. 
You would not use an LLM to preserve information, the weights are ever changing, the models continue to
grow.

Are religions still relevant?

Is the bible still relevant?

Should I talk about this physical world in this repo on GitHub?

To protect my privacy?
