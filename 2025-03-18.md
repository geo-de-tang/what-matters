Daniel interpreted the king's dreams.

I had a dream last night. I was at a grocery store like an HEB. 
The checkout system was down. People were stealing from the store, 
everyone was walking out without paying. I began trying to
get people to pay, first by telling them. Then they refused, and I threatened
to shoot them with a pistol. I had limited bullets and there were tens of people.

After threatening them with force and shooting the gun in the air, some people started to pay.
There was an Indian guy, I asked him, "are you here to steal?" He replied, "yes". I asked, "why?
Don't you have a girlfriend and self-respect?" He replied, "yes". I said, "there's a contradiction
there, if you had respect for yourself, you'd respect others too." Then I handcuffed him and removed
him from the store.

Then, one of my former classmates from high school, who I thought was an actual police officer, who isn't in reality, detained me and removed
me from the store. I was put into handcuffs, and I walked out of the store with my arms. There was a raised
garden bed for a tree right outside the store where the officer released me. I felt like I had done
the right thing, but I still was removed to somehow preserve some peace.

I woke up shortly after that.
