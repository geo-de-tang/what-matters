You and your research.

People think sequentially and not in parallel, and yet the gpu market has
exploded. Reality happens in parallel.

Why do dreams matter?

I had another dream today.

I went to the bathroom. This was a large men's restroom. It had many
urinals lined up on 3 walls near the entrance. There was a urinal
installed on the door of the bathroom. 

I went to the bathroom, did my business, and as I left, an acquaintance
was using the urinal on the door. Except, he wasn't going in the urinal;
he was going with his back to the door.

I pushed him aside by opening the door, and I walked out into a familiar
neighborhood in which I grew up.

I thought the situation was very strange, and I realized he was not going
in the urinal, because someone could've walked in on him. So I didn't think
that he was crazy. 

Then I woke up.
