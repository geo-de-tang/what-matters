I'm writing down my dream today at 7:52 PM, because I woke up
at 8:50 AM and I had plans. Today is Wednesday. That should be significant
to the future me who is reading this.

I dreamed that I was running a restaurant. The restaurant had a lot
of items on its menu, and I was either giving advice or taking advice
that the menu needed one item and that one item should have add-ons,
and that should be the size of the menu.

It was a short dream, I don't think I slept that well.
I'm not sure if I remember all of it.
